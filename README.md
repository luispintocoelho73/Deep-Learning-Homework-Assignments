Two Homework Assigments for the Deep Learning Course (https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/AProf-2/2021-2022/1-semestre)

The two Homework Assigments were done in a group and can be found in the "homework_part_1" and "homework_part_2" folders.

The first homework, presented in the homework_assigment_part_1.pdf file, consisted in some theoritical questions and in the implementation, training and testing of two main models: one regression model for predicting/determining house prices and an image classification model implemented with and without a deep-learning framework with automatic differentiation (in this case PyTorch). The homework_report_part_1.pdf file contains a report detailing the approach our group took to tackle these problems.

The second homework, presented in the homework_assigment_part_2.pdf file, consisted in other theoritical questions and also in the implementation, training and testing of two models, using PyTorch: another image classification model, this time implemented with a convolutional neural network (CNN) instead of using a feed foward neural network, and an image captioning model with a CNN-based encoder, that extracts the main features from the input images, and a long short-term memory model, that generates word-by-word captions from those features. The homework_report_part_2.pdf file contains a report detailing the approach our group took to tackle these problems.
